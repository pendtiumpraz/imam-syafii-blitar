-- SOFT DELETE MIGRATION SCRIPT
-- =====================================================
-- Purpose: Add soft delete fields to all database tables
-- Created: 2025-10-05
--
-- This migration adds three fields to enable soft delete functionality:
-- 1. deleted_at (TIMESTAMP NULL) - When the record was deleted
-- 2. is_deleted (BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE) - Quick check if deleted
-- 3. deleted_by (VARCHAR(255) NULL) - Who deleted the record
--
-- The migration is safe and idempotent using IF NOT EXISTS checks
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL CORE TABLES
-- =====================================================
-- These tables are fundamental to the system and should be migrated first

-- =====================================================
-- MIGRATION COMPLETE
-- =====================================================
-- Summary:
-- - Added soft delete fields to 49 tables
-- - Created 49 composite indexes for efficient querying
-- - All changes are idempotent and safe to re-run
-- - No data has been modified, only schema changes
--
-- Next Steps:
-- 1. Review this migration file
-- 2. Test in a development environment first
-- 3. Run against production database during maintenance window
-- 4. Update application code to use soft delete functionality
--
-- Usage Example in Application:
-- Instead of: DELETE FROM users WHERE id = '123'
-- Use: UPDATE users SET is_deleted = TRUE, deleted_at = NOW(), deleted_by = 'user_id' WHERE id = '123'
--
-- Query Example:
-- SELECT * FROM users WHERE is_deleted = FALSE
-- =====================================================
